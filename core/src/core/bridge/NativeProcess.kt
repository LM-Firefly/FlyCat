/**
 * A handle to the PIE core running as a child process, launched via fork+execve with a socketpair
 * control channel. YumeBox's equivalent of CFA's `AndroidProcess`.
 *
 * [channelFd] is the parent-side end of the socketpair; wrap it in a [Channel] to exchange control
 * messages (and to hand the TUN fd to the core via SCM_RIGHTS in the non-root path). The core reads
 * its own end from the `CHANNEL` environment variable.
 *
 * NOTE: this is the *non-root* launch primitive (the app fork+execs the binary directly). The root
 * path launches the same binary through `su` (libsu `Shell`) instead and talks to it purely over the
 * UNIX controller socket; it does not use [start].
