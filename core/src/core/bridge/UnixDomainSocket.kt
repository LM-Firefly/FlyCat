/**
 * A [java.net.Socket] backed by a UNIX-domain connection to the local core's mihomo controller, so
 * an OkHttp `SocketFactory` can speak HTTP over it. YumeBox's analogue of CFA's `UnixSocket`.
 *
 * Constructed with no [SocketImpl] (`super(null as SocketImpl?)`) so the JDK never allocates a real
 * TCP impl; every method OkHttp touches is overridden to delegate to the underlying fd. Stream
 * closes are decoupled from the fd (reads/writes go through [Os] on the raw descriptor, and only
 * [close] releases it) so OkHttp reading the response while the request stream is done does not
 * tear down the connection.
