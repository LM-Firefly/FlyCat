 * The socketpair control channel to the core child process ([NativeProcess.channelFd]). It is a
 * SOCK_SEQPACKET socket, so one write is one read (no framing needed), and each message can carry
 * a single file descriptor via SCM_RIGHTS — this is how the TUN fd is handed to the core in the
 * non-root VpnService path.
 *
 * YumeBox's equivalent of CFA's `AndroidChannel`. This is a thin fd wrapper; message framing and
 * the command vocabulary live in the Kotlin layer above it.
