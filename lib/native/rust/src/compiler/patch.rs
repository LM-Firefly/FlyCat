//! Two independent jobs live here:
//! * [`document`] applies user override documents (YAML patches with key modifiers);
//! * [`runtime`] applies the non-negotiable runtime patches the app needs (listeners, providers,
//!   DNS backfill, tun handling), with [`paths`] normalizing provider paths into profile scope.
