 * Builds the traffic-statistics Room database and returns its DAO.

 * Keeping construction here confines the `TrafficDatabase` / `RoomDatabase` / `Room` types to
 * `:data`; callers (e.g. `:app` DI wiring) only ever touch [TrafficStatisticsDao], which exposes no
 * Room supertypes in its signatures. This lets `:data` keep Room as an `implementation` dependency
 * without leaking it onto the `:app` compile classpath.
